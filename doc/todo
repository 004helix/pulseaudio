Post 0.8:
- alsa mmap driver
- dbus/hal
- polish for starting polypaudio as root/system-wide instance
- chroot()
- module-tunnel: improve latency calculation
- port from howl to avahi
- multiline configuration statements
- use scatter/gather io for sockets
- rtp module ported to Win32 (sendmsg/recvmsg emulation)
- CODECs to reduce bandwidth usage (plug-in based)
- Remove symdef files and use macros (like most other projects)
- use software volume when hardware doesn't support all channels (alsa done)
- paplay needs to set a channel map. our default is only correct for AIFF.
  (we need help from libsndfile for this)
- silence generation should be moved into the core to avoid races and code
  duplication in the backends
- examine if it is possible to mimic esd's handling of half duplex cards
  (switch to capture when a recording client connects and drop playback during
  that time)
- Fix a way for the threading API to handle state and subscription callbacks
  in a nice way.
- iconv stuff sent from utils to server (UTF-8)
- iconv stuff leaving the server (e.g. syslog). Sample loading probably needs
  help as well.
- Document utf8.h, timeval.h and util.h
- strerror() needs to be wrapped as it returns stuff in the current locale
  and we tend to pass it to functions that require UTF-8.
- fix clock of the NULL sink

Long term:
- pass meta info for hearing impaired
- X11: support for the X11 synchronization extension

Backends for:
- portaudio  (semi-done)
- sdl
- OSS (esddsp style)
