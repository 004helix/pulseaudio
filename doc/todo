Post 0.8:
- alsa mmap driver
- dbus/hal
- polish for starting polypaudio as root/system-wide instance
- chroot()
- add threading API
- module-tunnel: improve latency calculation
- port from howl to avahi
- multiline configuration statements
- use scatter/gather io for sockets
- add a synchronous API (base it on xmms-polyp)
- rtp module ported to Win32 (sendmsg/recvmsg emulation)
- CODECs to reduce bandwidth usage (plug-in based)
- Remove symdef files and use macros (like most other projects)
- use software volume when hardware doesn't support all channels (alsa done)
- double check channel maps for backends, including that mixer and pcm match
- paplay needs to set a channel map. our default is only correct for AIFF.
  (we need help from libsndfile for this)

Long term:
- pass meta info for hearing impaired
- X11: support for the X11 synchronization extension

Backends for:
- portaudio  (semi-done)
- sdl
- OSS (esddsp style)
- gstreamer (needs to be updated)
- fix channel maps in all external backends. Take care when doing volume
  changes if you're modifying a sink/source since those might have a different
  map.
