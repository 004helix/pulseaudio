Test:
- module-combine
- latency foo

Fixes:
- improve module-oss-mmap latency measurement
- module-tunnel: improve latency calculation
- make alsa modules use mmap
- better validity checking in libpolyp and protocol-{native,esound}
- don't build ipv4 and ipv6 modules seperately
- change pa_log to not require \n

Features:
- add radio module
- dbus/hal
- polish for starting polypaudio as root/system-wide instance
- add threading API
- add support for auth using SCM_CREDENTIALS
- include hw description in sink/source info
- use scatter/gather io for sockets
- hw volume support for alsa, oss-mmap, windows, solaris
- notifcation on hw volume change
- source volume control
- deal with underflows reported by OSS/ALSA properly

Long term:
- pass meta info for hearing impaired
- X11: support for the X11 synchronization extension

Backends for:
- portaudio  (semi-done)
- sdl
- OSS (esddsp style)

------------------

Done:
- per-channel volume
- channel mapping ("left", "right", "rear", "subwoofer")
- hardware volume support
- alsa-lib
- remove "polyplib-" prefix
- add API for synchronizing multiple sinks/sources to a common clock
- absolutely indexed write()s from client
