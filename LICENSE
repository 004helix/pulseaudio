All Polypaudio sources are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License. (see file LGPL for details)

However, the server side links to the GPL-only library 'libsamplerate' which
downgrades the license of the server part to GPL (see file GPL for details),
exercising section 3 of the LGPL.

Hence you should treat the client library ('libpolyp') of Polypaudio as being
LGPL licensed and the server part ('libpolypcore') as being GPL licensed.
