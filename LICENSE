All Polypaudio source files are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License. (see file LGPL for details)

However, the server side links to the GPL-only library 'libsamplerate' which
practically downgrades the license of the server part to GPL (see file GPL for
details), exercising section 3 of the LGPL.

Hence you should treat the client library ('libpolyp') of Polypaudio as being
LGPL licensed and the server part ('libpolypcore') as being GPL licensed. Since
the Polypaudio daemon and the modules link to 'libpolypcore' they are of course
also GPL licensed.
