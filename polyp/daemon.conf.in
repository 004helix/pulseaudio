## Configuration file for the polypaudio daemon. Default values are
## commented out.  Use either ; or # for commenting

# Extra verbositiy
; verbose = 0

## Daemonize after startup
; daemonize = 0

## Quit if startup fails
; fail = 1

## Renice the daemon to level -15 and try to get SCHED_FIFO
## scheduling. This a good idea if you hear annyoing noise in the
## playback. However, this is a certain security issue, since it works 
## when called SUID root only. root is dropped immediately after gaining
## the nice level and SCHED_FIFO scheduling on startup.
; high-priority = 0

## Disallow module loading after startup
; disallow-module-loading = 0

## Terminate the daemon after the last client quit and this time
## passed. Use a negative value to disable this feature.
; exit-idle-time = -1

## Unload autoloaded modules after being idle for this time 
; module-idle-time = 20

## The path were to look for dynamic shared objects (DSOs aka
## plugins).  You may specify more than one path seperated by
## colons. 
; dl-search-path = @DLSEARCHPATH@

## The default script file to load. Specify an empty string for not
## loading a default script file. The 
; default-script-file = @DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE@

## The default log target. Use either "stderr", "syslog" or
## "auto". The latter is equivalent to "sylog" in case daemonize is
## true, otherwise to "stderr".

## The resampling algorithm to use. Use one of sinc-best-quality,
## sinc-medium-quality, sinc-fastest, zero-order-hold, linear.  See
## the documentation of libsamplerate for an explanation fot the
## different methods.
