## Configuration file for the pulseaudio daemon. Default values are
## commented out.  Use either ; or # for commenting

## Daemonize after startup
; daemonize = no

## Quit if startup fails
; fail = yes

## Renice the daemon to level -15. This a good idea if you experience
## drop-outs in the playback. However, this is a certain security
## issue, since it works when called SUID root only. root is dropped
## immediately after gaining the nice level on startup, thus it is
## presumably safe.
; high-priority = yes

## Try to acquire SCHED_FIFO scheduling for the IO threads. The same
## security concerns as mentioned above apply. However, if PA enters
## an endless loop, realtime scheduling causes a system lockup. Thus,
## realtime scheduling should only be enabled on trusted machines for
## now. Please not that only the IO threads of PulseAudio are made
## real-time. The controlling thread is left a normally scheduled
## thread. Thus the enabling the high-priority option is orthogonal.
; realtime-scheduling = no

## The realtime priority to acquire, if realtime-scheduling is
## enabled. (Note: JACK uses 10 by default, 9 for clients -- some
## PulseAudio threads might choose a priority a little lower or higher
## than this value.)
; realtime-priority = 5

## The nice level to acquire for the daemon, if high-priority is
## enabled. (Note: on some distributions X11 uses -10 by default.)
; nice-level = -11

## Disallow module loading after startup
; disallow-module-loading = no

## Terminate the daemon after the last client quit and this time
## passed. Use a negative value to disable this feature.
; exit-idle-time = -1

## Unload autoloaded modules after being idle for this time
; module-idle-time = 20

## Unload autoloaded sample cache entries after being idle for this time
; scache-idle-time = 20

## The path were to look for dynamic shared objects (DSOs aka
## plugins).  You may specify more than one path seperated by
## colons.
; dl-search-path = @PA_DLSEARCHPATH@

## The default script file to load. Specify an empty string for not
## loading a default script file. The
; default-script-file = @PA_DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE@

## The default log target. Use either "stderr", "syslog" or
## "auto". The latter is equivalent to "sylog" in case daemonize is
## true, otherwise to "stderr".
; log-target = auto

# Log level, one of debug, info, notice, warning, error. Log messages
# with a lower log level than specified here are not logged,
; log-level = notice

## The resampling algorithm to use. Use one of src-sinc-best-quality,
## src-sinc-medium-quality, src-sinc-fastest, src-zero-order-hold,
## src-linear, trivial, speex-float-N, speex-fixed-N, ffmpeg. See the
## documentation of libsamplerate for an explanation for the different
## src- methods. The method 'trivial' is the most basic algorithm
## implemented. If you're tight on CPU consider using this. On the
## other hand it has the worst quality of them all. The speex
## resamplers take an integer quality setting in the range 0..9
## (bad...good). They exist in two flavours: fixed and float. The
## former uses fixed point numbers, the latter relies on floating
## point numbers. On most desktop CPUs the float point resmapler is a
## lot faster, and it also offers slightly better quality.
; resample-method = speex-float-3

## Create a PID file in /tmp/pulseaudio-$USER/pid. Of this is enabled
## you may use commands like "pulseaudio --kill" or "pulseaudio
## --check". If you are planning to start more than one pulseaudio
## process per user, you better disable this option since it
## effectively disables multiple instances.
; use-pid-file = yes

## Do not install the CPU load limit, even on platforms where it is
## supported. This option is useful when debugging/profiling
## PulseAudio to disable disturbing SIGXCPU signals.
; no-cpu-limit = no

## Run the daemon as system-wide instance, requires root priviliges
; system-instance = no

## Resource limits, see getrlimit(2) for more information. Set to -1
## if PA shouldn't touch the resource limit. Not all resource limits
## are available on all operating systems.
; rlimit-as = -1
; rlimit-core = -1

; rlimit-fsize = -1

; rlimit-nproc = -1
; rlimit-memlock = 16384
; rlimit-nice = 31

## Disable shared memory data transfer
; disable-shm = no

## Default sample format
; default-sample-format = s16le
; default-sample-rate = 44100

## Default fragment settings, for device drivers that need this
; default-fragments = 4
