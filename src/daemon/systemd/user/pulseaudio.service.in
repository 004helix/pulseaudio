[Unit]
Description=Sound Service

# We require pulseaudio.socket to be active before starting the daemon, for two
# reasons:
#
# 1. There are no implicit dependencies between sockets and services, so
#    the socket, as set up by systemd will race with the socket, as set up
#    by the pulseaudio daemon. This can cause the pulseaudio.socket unit to
#    fail (even though the pulseaudio service started just fine), which can
#    confuse users.
# 2. While it is possible to use the service without the socket, it is not
#    clear why it would be desirable. And a user installing pulseaudio and
#    doing `systemctl --user start pulseaudio` will not get the socket
#    started, which might be confusing and problematic if the server is to
#    be restarted later on, as the client autospawn feature might kick in.
