Post 0.9.0:
- alsa mmap driver
- dbus/hal (Shams King is working on this one)
- polish for starting polypaudio as root/system-wide instance
- chroot()
- module-tunnel: improve latency calculation
- multiline configuration statements
- use scatter/gather io for sockets
- rtp module ported to Win32 (sendmsg/recvmsg emulation)
- CODECs to reduce bandwidth usage (plug-in based)
- Remove symdef files and use macros (like most other projects)
- Use own name mangling scheme instead of ltdl's, which will eliminate the
  need for .la files or extra trickery.
- use software volume when hardware doesn't support all channels (alsa done)
- paplay needs to set a channel map. our default is only correct for AIFF.
  (we need help from libsndfile for this)
- silence generation should be moved into the core to avoid races and code
  duplication in the backends
- examine if it is possible to mimic esd's handling of half duplex cards
  (switch to capture when a recording client connects and drop playback during
  that time)
- Fix a way for the threading API to handle state and subscription callbacks
  in a nice way.
- iconv stuff sent from utils to server (UTF-8)
- iconv sample loading in server
- Document utf8.h, timeval.h and util.h
- fix clock of the NULL sink
- gettextify polypaudio
- use send() with MSG_NOSIGNAL instead of write() wherever possible, and than drop that SIGPIPE warning
- drop dependency of libpolyp on libX11, instead use an external mini binary
- "hot" moving of streams between sinks
- gconf module + frontend
- hooks for creating sink inputs
- insert the low-level device name in the default sink/source name, to make them recognizable

Long term:
- pass meta info for hearing impaired
- X11: support for the X11 synchronization extension

Backends for:
- portaudio  (semi-done)
- sdl
- xine (needs update)
